            <p>CSS is another thing you may learn just after understanding HTML. CSS stands for the cascading style sheets, which Hakon Wium Lie created in 1994. Hakon Wium Lie is considered the father of CSS as he created this amazing thing. And he used to work with the father of HTML, Mr. Tim Berners-Lee, when he was working in CERN.</p>
            <p>CSS was offered as the web styling language to make it appealing. And it was the solution that most of the users of HTML were looking at that time. When it launched, the users could use HTML 4.01 and CSS together to make their web pages more attractive.</p>

            <p>HTML is the short form of HyperText Markup language, and most people assume it as a programming language. But it is a markup language rather than any coding or programming language. It is used for most web pages and applications to define the text and body of the layout.</p>
            <p>HTML is the most popular markup language that was developed and written by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he created the world wide web too in 1989; however, his HTML version officially launched in 1993. from that time to now, HTML has seen continuous updates to add new features and functionality.</p>

            <h1>What Does CSS Stand For?</h1>
            <p>CSS is mainly used for web development or page design. It refers to the cascading style sheets that can format the web page layouts using many features. It can style the text, manage table size, and edit other aspects of the web pages to make them attractive. By using CSS, the user can give a uniform look to the website and its several pages. It does not only define the table but also meets other design needs of the website.</p>
            <p>With the help of CSS, the user can make changes in several pages just at once. Suppose, if you need to make the text bigger of all the web pages, then by changing the font size in CSS, you can make the text size bigger. And there are many other things that you can do easily using cascading style sheets. And because of these features, CSS has become a crucial language for web design and development.</p>

            <h1>Origin of CSS</h1>
            <p>CSS came into existence in 1994, so it can provide a standard way to design the pages on the world wide web. And Mr. Lee developed a cascading style sheet for the same purpose. Because by this time, there was an immense demand for such a solution as HTML 4.01 was unable to give an appealing web page on its own. However, by seeing it, many people offered different styling sheets, but none of them succeeded as CSS. In its initial stage, it was primarily used for making websites accessible and appealing.</p>

            <h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>
            <p>Along with HTML, CSS is also standardized by W3C that controls the web standards. CSS is free to use, independent and it is also an open-source standard. And users can use HTML and CSS together with the W3C.</p>
            <p>If we look at the history of CSS, we will find it has seen mainly three updates. CSS level 1 was launched in 1996, and it came again in 1999 with some improvements. However, CSS level 2 or CSS2 came in 1998 with media support. In this version, the user can utilize the other media elements. And finally, its latest version, CSS level 3, launched, and currently, we use this version only. The latest version of CSS allows us to take advantage of separation that helps in saving time.</p>
            <p>If you need to make some critical changes on a large website with hundreds of pages. Currently, CSS comes with over 60 modules with different features. In recent years, most developers and designers have tried a variety of browsers to see the effects of CSS on web pages. But most of them found Firefox as the most helpful for the same concern.</p>

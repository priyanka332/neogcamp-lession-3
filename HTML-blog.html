        <p>HTML is one of the first things that a student learns during a web development course. Hence, it becomes essential to learn about the history of HTML and its version in an accurate timeline.</p>
        <p>So, if you are also a web development learning enthusiast and wish to have a deep understanding of the same. Then read this crucial article to understand some foundational information about the same.</p>

        <p>HTML is the short form of HyperText Markup language, and most people assume it as a programming language. But it is a markup language rather than any coding or programming language. It is used for most web pages and applications to define the text and body of the layout.</p>
        <p>HTML is the most popular markup language that was developed and written by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he created the world wide web too in 1989; however, his HTML version officially launched in 1993. from that time to now, HTML has seen continuous updates to add new features and functionality.</p>

            <h1>Origin of HTML</h1>
            <p>The concept of HTML came to the mind of Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he saw researchers at CERN need to share documents many times. And then, he proposed that he develop a markup language that would help connect computers worldwide. According to this idea, the ordinary user can access the file of one computer from another computing device by accessing the markup language he proposed. Hypertext system refers to the set or the network of documents written in text and connected using hyperlinks. And using this, the researchers could jump to other files just by clicking on hyperlinks.</p>
            <p>And with the same vision, he wrote the software of browser and servers for hypertext markup language by 1990. However, CERN did not give any funds for this vital project of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But still, Lee posted the initial description for the HTML tags in 1991, and it was finally released in 1993.</p>

            <p>Once the initial version of HTML was out, then there were many updates. But the most popular version of it was HTML4.01 which became the standard markup language in 1999. Another crucial version, XHTML. It was the XML format of HTML; the XML language has been used in creating many markup languages. The RSS and MathML are a few examples of the markup languages that are written using XML language. The XHTML language became a standard markup language in 2000, and it got updated again in 2002. earlier, most of the web pages and applications used to be developed using HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years HTML5 has become the standard markup language for defining the various attributes for web pages.</p>
